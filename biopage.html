        <p>Hi! My name is Ruben Jevremovic. I am from South Bend, Indiana, and I attend Riley High School. I made this HTML page in my Computer Science I class. It has some of my project on it.</p>

        <p>This is a puppy. It is not my puppy. It is just a puppy. That I found online. You're welcome.</div>

        <h3>Greedy Guy</h3>
        <p>To the right is a project that I finished in the first semester of my Computer Science I class. It is called Greedy Guy and is about a guy who wants all his relics back. He starts with five lives, but the gems can give him an extra life. There are multiple enemies, and if any one of them is touched, a life is lost. There is a small invincibility time after losing a life.<p>

        <h3>IED Portfolio</h3>
        <p>This is a Google Slides presentation that I made in my Freshman Introduction to Engineering and Design class. It contains all of my work for that class. Some of the items in there are a toy train project, a puzzle cube, and perspective drawings. Have a look!<p>
